            <h2>About </h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Guillaume Nadal, I recently completed my Master’s degree in Engineering Physics at Polytechnique Montréal, where I conducted my thesis research in the Nano Quantum Semiconductor Laboratory. My work bridged experimental solid-state physics, quantum systems, and data analysis. I gained hands-on experience developing and operating precise laboratory systems, as well as using programming tools for data acquisition and analysis.

                I am deeply motivated by the development of high-performance experimental setups and thrive in collaborative research environments. I enjoy taking initiative to optimize workflows, improve instrumentation, and troubleshoot complex systems.

                    <h3>APT reconstruction</h3>
                    <p>Atom Probe Tomography (APT) is an advanced microscopy technique that employs field ion emission
                        to extract individual atoms from a material, enabling a precise 3D reconstruction of its atomic
                        structure. This project aims to enhance reconstruction accuracy by integrating crystal plane data.</p>

                    <h3>Cadmium Zinc Telluride</h3>
                    <p>This project focuses on understanding the defect structures in the CdZnTe alloy, a material
                        widely used in medical imaging for X-ray detection. CdZnTe crystals often contain various
                        structural defects, and gaining insight into these surrounding defects can directly contribute
                        to improving the crystal growth process. </p>

                    <h3>Sample management interface</h3>
                    <p>Developed a full-stack interface to manage diverse samples and securely store experimental data
                        for our research group. Leveraging Next.js for the frontend, Django for the API, and PostgreSQL
                        for data storage, this project streamlines our workflow, prevents data loss, and ensures clear
                        tracking of each step in the microfabrication process.</p>

                    <p> Quandela is a company focused on developing optical quantum computing using single-photon sources.
                        Perceval, their simulation library, models the behavior of photons as they move through various
                        gates and optical paths. I made simulations to analyze how delays in photon emission impact the
                        fidelity of the output.</p>

                    <p> I was a member of the technical society at Polyloop, where I designed a braking system of the
                        HyperLoop capsule. I used SolidWorks to make a design.

                Recipient of an Excellence Mention and nominated for the Best Thesis Award, I conducted my research in
                the Nano Quantum Semiconductor Laboratory under Prof. Oussama Moutanabbir. My work focused on
                semiconductors and metals, thin films, and detectors for X-ray, gamma-ray, and infrared radiation.
                I studied the crystal structure of materials and performed data analysis of atom probe tomography
                datasets, developing Python algorithms to process large-scale data and extract meaningful insights.
                In addition, I programmed a user interface, API and Data Base to organize and manage sample processing
                data.
